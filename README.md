# Budget Management Smart Contract

This README provides an overview of the Budget Management Smart Contract written in Cadence. The contract is designed to manage budgets for various accounts, allowing users to create and retrieve budget items.

## Overview

The Budget Management Smart Contract consists of the following components:

1.  **Cadence Contract**: This part defines the data structures and functions that make up the smart contract.
    
2.  **Cadence Transactions**: These transactions allow users to interact with the contract by creating budget items.
    
3.  **Cadence Scripts**: These scripts allow users to query and retrieve budget items from the contract.
    

## Cadence Contract

The Cadence contract defines the data structures and functions required for managing budgets. Here is an overview of the contract:

-   **Budget** is a contract that holds budget items for various accounts.
    
-   **BudgetItem** is a struct that represents a budget item and contains the following fields:
    
    -   `account`: The account associated with the budget item.
    -   `title`: A short title or name for the budget item.
    -   `description`: A description of the budget item.
    -   `amount`: The amount allocated for the budget.
    -   `isActive`: A boolean indicating whether the budget item is active.
    -   `createdDate`: The date when the budget item was created.
-   The `init()` function initializes an empty dictionary to store budget items.
    
-   The `createBudget` function allows users to create a new budget item and store it in the contract's dictionary. It requires an account, title, description, amount, isActive, and createdDate as parameters.
    

## Cadence Transactions

The Cadence transactions define the interactions users can perform with the contract. There is one transaction in this example:

-   **createBudget** is a transaction that allows a user to create a new budget item. It takes the following parameters:
    -   `account`: The account associated with the budget item.
    -   `title`: A short title or name for the budget item.
    -   `description`: A description of the budget item.
    -   `amount`: The amount allocated for the budget.
    -   `isActive`: A boolean indicating whether the budget item is active.
    -   `createdDate`: The date when the budget item was created.

## Cadence Scripts

The Cadence scripts define how users can query the contract to retrieve budget items. There is one script in this example:

-   **main** is a script that takes an account address as a parameter and returns the corresponding budget item from the contract's dictionary. It allows users to retrieve budget items associated with specific accounts.

## Usage

To use this smart contract, you need a compatible blockchain platform that supports Cadence smart contracts. You can deploy the contract, create budget items using the `createBudget` transaction, and retrieve budget items using the `main` script.

Please note that this is a simplified example, and in a real-world scenario, you would need additional functionalities, such as updating and deleting budget items, managing access control, and handling more complex business logic.

For more information on deploying and interacting with Cadence contracts, refer to the documentation of the specific blockchain platform you are using.
